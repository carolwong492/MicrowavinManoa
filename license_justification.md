Microwavin Manoa uses the MIT License as we believe in the collaborative spirit of open source development. The MIT License provides the most freedom to other users and developers, which encourages them to contribute to the project or use it to create new, specific derivative works that best suit their own purposes. Users are able to freely view, copy, modify, distribute, and sell the source code within this project as long as these copies or susbstantial portions of the code include the MIT license and copyright license. As the MIT License is a very simple and easily understandable license that grants a lot of freedoms with very few restrictions, we hope to foster a welcoming community of users and contributors with our open-source application.
