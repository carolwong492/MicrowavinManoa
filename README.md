# Microwavin Manoa
Many college students have limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, limited access to grocery stores, and no access to creative recipes that respect these constraints. As a result, college students spend money to eat out, or eat non-healthy foods at fast food places or through vending machines.

Microwavin Manoa creates a way for students (on-campus or off) to learn and share recipes that:
- Can be made using minimal kitchen facilities (at a minimum, a toaster oven, or a microwave!).
- Can be made out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH.
- Can be filtered via dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc).
- Have an estimated cost per serving.
- Has an estimated number of servings per recipe.
- Has an estimate of how long it takes to make.
